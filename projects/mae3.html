<p> I was part of a three person team that designed a joystick-controlled robot for an in-class robot contest.
	I designed the robot in AutoCAD, Solidworks. I also led the team in fabrication (mostly laser cut acrylic)
	and control of the robot.
	We lost in the first round of the contest, but it was a good learning experience..
