<p> I worked on this project as a research assistant for a Masters studentâ€™s project. Soft robot leg made of silicone, actuated with soft pneumatic air channels combined with strain limiting layer in the middle.
My contributions were: CADing /3D printing the molds for various parts of the leg, assisting with video capture for color tracking, testing different silicone materials, fabrication of leg.
The prototype in the picture was presented at the Soft Robotics workshop at ICRA 2015 in Seattle.
