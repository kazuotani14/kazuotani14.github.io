<p>
This was a project for MAE 143C (Digital Controls) at UCSD.
I designed lead-lag controllers with successive loop closure, based on a simplified dynamical model.
Tuned controllers and IMU filters on MATLAB, converted to difference equations and implemented in C on Debian.
Added support for Wifi dongle for remote control, 3D printed an attachment for a webcam to stream video over Wifi.
Video of simple balancing available <a href="https://youtu.be/3NEDx2KUvKw">here</a>.
