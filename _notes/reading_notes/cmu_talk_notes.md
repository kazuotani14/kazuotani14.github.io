# CMU Talk notes

### RI seminars

##### Frank Dellaert 2/2/2018

* Consistent distributed smoothing and mapping. DDF-SAM 2.0 
* Skydio 3D mapping deep learning pipeline at CVPR
* Write unit tests! Looks at Jenkins and Travis Ci again 
* “Twiddle” 
* CRFs are essentially factor graphs - hanging these as “deep” features on factor graphs 

* Pseudospectral optimal control: instead of representing trajectory as series of poses, represent it with polynomial basis functions 
    * Use this for SLAM 
* Chevyshev polynomials are collapsed cosines (see Trefethen) - wrap cosine around circle, squish onto one plane. Collocation: dynamic defects for SLAM. Recover control sequence from inference 
* Try gtsam 
* SLAM only takes a few percent of computation/memory - most is taken by deep learning/vision, tracking. Mostly because only tracking over fixed slab of trajectory (most recent 12 poses) 


### Other talks 

#####  Michael Mauldin (pioneer lectures) 2/15/18

* as soon as you wonder if you need a lawyer, get one
* As soon you own stock in anything, get a good tax accountant. He has a fiduciary duty to not screw you 
* When you get a windfall, spend half and save half 
* Owning 5 different cryptocurrencies is not diversification 
* Property taxes are insidious, but a farm or ranch can be “ag exempt”, lowering your tax bill. Hawaii does not tax property 
* The early bird gets the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese 

Most influential books 

* The art of computer programming, Knuth 
* Software tools, Kernighan and Plauger 
* Harvard mba handbook, Fisk and Barron 
* Positioning, ries and trout 
* Looking our for #1, Robert J ringer
* learn to earn, Peter lynch 
* Atlas shrugged, ayn rand 

If you can make something people use once a year, you can make a profit. If you can make something people use every day, you can be rich.

##### Rick Rashid (Pioneer Lectures) 2/1/2018

Founder of Microsoft Research

Importance of research: original argument for NSF by Bush: when we have a crisis like disease, famine, war, we want a treasure chest of ideas and people to draw on. E.g. world war 2 involved a lot of smart people figuring out hard problems. Same for companies: when business climate changes and the company has to be able to change, research provides ideas, solutions, people to provide the ability to rapidly adapt. Basic research is an investment 

Difference between product and research is the level of risk you’re willing to take. If you can take risks and fail without being punished, that’s research 


##### Pioneer Lectures 2 - Language technologies guy 

Exits: generally ~50% goes to taxes, partners get significant part, banks and investors get first dibs. 

Globally, to be top 1% financially you need to be making ~35k/year. In US, ~350k/year 

Do you really want to be filthy rich?
