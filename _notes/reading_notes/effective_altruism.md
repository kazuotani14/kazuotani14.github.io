### Notes

_Action items_

1. Set up a habit of giving regularly (even if it’s $10/month)
    * Save enough to live for 6 months, and some for retirement. Give 1% during this time and keep learning
2. Write down plan for how I’m going to incorporate EA into my life. How, what, when? In donations, career, consumption?
3. Join the EA community (effectivealtruism.org), sign up for mailing list 
4. Tell others about EA 

[Giving What We Can](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org): pledge to donate 10% of lifetime earnings

_Key questions_

* What do I want out of life? 
    * To be happy
    * To make the world a better place 
* Why do I want these things? 
* How can I optimally achieve these things (with the least resources wasted, and maximum good)

Immediate action item: start donating 1-5% of my salary (pre-tax?) to effective charities 

Estimated cost to save one life in the developing world: $3400 

The impact I have on the world (“good”) may be big. I might even reshape or create an entire industry! Even then, the good that I can do through donations to the right causes might be larger than the good I do through my work. This might even be true for Bill Gates!! A counterpoint here is that some people are uniquely positioned (skills, network, time, location) to do something others can’t do, e.g. by changing the trajectory of history (e.g. Ukrainian guy starting campaign for smallpox eradication, Jonas Salk’s polio vaccine). Insights that you are uniquely positioned to have and act on. New ideas are mostly just combinations of existing ideas, so that insight will probably come about whether you have it or not (as evidenced by many examples of parallel developments of ideas in science). However, if this insight will have a positive impact, and if it hasn’t happened yet, then there exists an opportunity cost of you not acting on it.

What is the end goal? “Improving lives”? “Helping the upward march of humanity”? What is the core thing that we value? Maybe  we can argue that humans/Earth is the first example we know of the universe becoming conscious of itself. This is beautiful/valuable in and of itself. 
But what if we are all living in a simulation? Isn’t the universe going to die a slow entropic death anyways? What’s the point? 
See Naval’s comment on thermodynamics 

Corollary: marginal benefit of me improving my programming skills is less than me improving my business, math/theory, knowledge in other fields, since there are less resources invested in this and less people are likely to be able to replicate my skill set. If a skill can be taught/trained, then you are replaceable. Look at naval’s quotes on work 

Are we just lying to ourselves when we give our careers meaning as “making the world better”? Or are we just not aware of the alternatives? If that was our primary goal, rational agents would (I think) make as much money as possible doing something that doesn’t do bad, then channel that money to high-impact causes in poor countries 

I guess the argument for technology development comes from:
* developing tools helps breakthroughs happen more often or faster or at all 
* Improve the quality of life in the developed world, so that when/if efforts in poor countries succeed in “leveling the playing field”, or at least getting everyone in the world to an acceptable quality of life, we can keep improving from there
* Technology is the main driver of economic development. Better economy leads to more opportunities for improving the world 

How do robots fit into this? Maybe look at hacktivists: René Carmille (head of French census that hacked census results on IBM punch cards to make Jews harder to find for Nazis), Satoshi Nakamoto starting a movement for technology that allows trust-less bookkeeping and less reliance on central authorities 
Look at second, third order effects! 

Some charities are less effective but are more relatable for people in the first world (e.g. make a wish foundation), or invoke more emotions/excitement. Malaria is twice as bad in terms of health impact worldwide, but it’s so cheap to solve that rich countries no longer suffer from it. But, cancer gets more funding than malaria 

EA=scientific method for optimization of social food that we do 

QALY (quality adjusted life years): “objective” method of comparing direct social impact 

Doctors have a much larger marginal impact by working in a poor country 

The good I do is not a matter of the direct benefits I cause; rather it is the difference that I make. (E.g. performing CPR poorly when a paramedic is around). What would have happened otherwise? “Assessing the counterfactual” 
Can I do this better than someone who would take my place? 

Earning to give: rather than increasing direct impact through work, working to increase salary so we can donate more
Donations are tax deductible 
Choosing to earn to give is a escape from having to do your job better than your replacement, because your replacement most likely won’t donate. Of course, you can do both 
To weigh career vs earning to give: find expected impact thru conservative estimates 

Think in terms of expected values! Probability * impact 
With this metric, some careers (politics, research, entrepreneurship, activism for systemic change ) can give greater expected impact than earning to give, since they have low probability of success with high impact 

Interesting concept: “micro-morts” as units for comparing relative danger of activities 

Aside: I found an interesting reddit thread asking: "Why are so many people in the effective altruism community nerdy"? I think this is because nerds are more likely to understand rational/probabilistic(expected value) thinking, and less likely to be driven by emotional pleas (e.g. Make a wish)

Giving directly (cash transfers) are effective, and low overhead. They can be thought of as the index fund of giving. Anything else must “beat the market” 

Sweatshops actually benefit those in poor countries. Sweatshop jobs are the good jobs! Alternatives are farm work, scavenging (e.g. pick up plastic to sell). Industrial work is also a stepping stone from cash crop society to more modern industrialized society 
Correct response to poor working conditions in sweatshops is not to boycott products that are produced in sweatshops, but to try to fix the underlying economic conditions that make sweatshops desirable places to work 
Author is generally skeptical of “ethical consumerism” 

Most effective method for cutting down on carbon footprint is to donate $100/year to cool earth (carbon offsetting)

The Effective Altruism community seems to be focused on the cause of "dealing with dangers of AI" as a primary issue. But I think that an equally important issue is: how can we use our current technologies to create wealth for the world? Universal income might be difficult because people are greedy, but universal opportunity and universal wealth (measured in resources like water, sanitation, electricity, education) are definitely possible, and can be enabled through policy changes and tech.
