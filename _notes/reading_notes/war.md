# War: reading notes

### Goals

Moral/ethical(what's diff between these?)/philosophical context for working at Shield AI, as well as participation in/understanding of politics

* Learn about general military, war, defense industry
	* talk to Dolan, read books, watch documentaries and movies
* Why is the US in Afghanistan in the first place?
* Is war still necessary? Or is backing the US military just the least bad of all of the options? (like democracy as a political system)
* Understand:
	  * History of Israel
	  * US president timeline, world war 1
	  * Arabs vs Persians, Shias vs Sunnis
	  * Taliban vs Al Qaeda

### Resources

_Done_

* Vox videos on middle east: helpful summaries
	- maps: https://www.vox.com/a/maps-explain-the-middle-east
* "Wired for War: The Robotics Revolution and Conflict in the 21st Century"
by P.W. Singer
* "America's War for the Greater Middle East", by Andrew J. Bacevich
	- Last chapter is worth re-reading. Cites main reasons that we can't win the war in Middle East, and why nothing has changed. What does this mean for companies like Shield, which provide tools for the military. A first-order effect is that there are less American troops dying in Afghanistan. A second-order effect may be that leaders, in seeing these improved statistics, infer an improved situation on the ground and make bad decisions (to either increase amount of force, or pull out in time of need). Author also points out that the real threat to American power and prosperity is now coming from Asia (China, India, North Korea), as well as global problems such as global warming.
	- If dropping exploratory quadrotors instead of bombs from planes can prevent unnecessary civilian deaths ("mistakes"), maybe that will be doing some good.

Susan: “Afghanistan needs the US military, because otherwise the Taliban would take over again” weak government, power vacuum?

What are the limitations of packbot? What are pros/cons of ground robots?

The internet/ARPAnet was originally made to decentralize information/communication for the US military and government.
Can blockchain improve upon this?
What kinds of robotics technologies could only come from a defense company?

Modern wars are fought in cityscapes, slums. How can we enhance intelligence/abilities in these situations with robotics/AI?

The public is not involved in democratic decision making process anymore, when it pertains to war. No personal (e.g. sons in military) or financial (factories used for supplies) involvement or “skin in the game”, especially for elites who make the decisions

How do we develop hardware that is war zone-ready?
Systems validation, six sigma in hardware and software

Important to consider not just the capabilities of the system, but also the effects that it will have on the person using the robot and their behavior. E.g. going to war with robots will make it lower cost (financially and/or in human lives), potentially making war a more enticing method of conflict resolution for leaders. Maybe the core issue here, as with many other world issues, comes down to education.

“The object of war is to secure a better peace”

Can Shield's robots be used in disaster zones as well? What are the assumptions that would be broken in this environment vs warzones?
* More requires 3D planning

"Following the latest string of unsuccessful operations that lacked a clear political endgame (e.g., Libya, Syria), the current administration seems to believe that retrenchment is the best approach, in part to facilitate a shift toward Asia. Yet retrenchment has only made the situation worse. The Middle East remains important to global security and thus American security, and the use of military force can still help manage the region's manifold dangers -- assuming such efforts are carefully managed, with goals that make sense and do not seek to transform entire societies."
"Second, policymakers should stop relying on tactical and technological solutions (as embodied in the Defense Department's "third offset strategy") for politically driven conflicts, where technology is usually less important than political and cultural savvy and sound geopolitical instincts."
"Yet completely walking away from the Middle East is not possible. Neither is large-scale conventional war. The answer lies somewhere in between -- military operations short of war that allow Washington and its partners to manage the region's security. The real debate on how (and whether) to actually do this is just beginning, even as a number of America's traditional roles in the region continue to change."

"The story of Islam's division between Sunni and Shia started with the Prophet Mohammed's death in 632. There was a power struggle over who would succeed him in ruling the Islamic Caliphate, with most Muslims wanting to elect the next leader but some arguing that power should go by divine birthright to Mohammed's son-in-law, Ali. That pro-Ali faction was known as the "Partisans of Ali," or "Shi'atu Ali" in Arabic, hence "Shia." Ali's eventual ascension to the throne sparked a civil war, which he and his partisans lost. The Shia held on to the idea that Ali was the rightful successor, and grew into an entirely separate branch of Islam. Today about 10 to 15 percent of Muslims worldwide are Shia — they are the majority group in Iran and Iraq only — while most Muslims are Sunni. "Sunni" roughly means "tradition." Today, that religious division is again a political one as well: it's a struggle for regional influence between Shia political powers, led by Iran, versus Sunni political powers, led by Saudi Arabia. This struggle looks an awful lot like a regional cold war, with proxy battles in Syria and elsewhere."

"The proper purpose of government is to protect individual rights by banning the use of physical force from social relationships and by using force only in retaliation and only against those who initiate its use.

According to Locke, we ought to part with no more of our rights to life, liberty, or property then is necessary for government to preserve those rights from each other. "The right to do whatever one thought fit to preserve oneself is given up to be regulated by society so far forth as the preservation of himself and others shall require. When any rights are given up, it is only with an intention in every one to better preserve himself, his liberty, and his property."[6] A corollary is that government officials ought not to be given more power to take away those rights than is necessary for government to fulfill its role of the preservation of those rights addressed by the statute." From _Interpreting Power: The Principle of Least Authority_ by Nick Szabo

A problem with most of my ideas for social change are that they end up being very authoritarian: in this case, I'm just like the people I disagree with, except in the ideas driving the authoritarian state.

People are mostly monkeys acting on short-term goals, either because of short-sightedness (lack of education, thought) or necessity (poverty, living from paycheck-to-paycheck). Design incentives! Connection to crypto-economics
