* Exporting matlab figures to pdf while avoiding whitespace:: export as eps file, then do `epstopdf fig.eps fig.pdf`

### Videos

* HitFilm Express for making clips of multiple videos next to each other
* Screen recordings in Windows: `Windows+G` to use Game Bar
* Clip videos with Quicktime

### Presentations

* Always have slide numbers - allows people to easily refer to them during questions
* Alternatives: Keynote, reveal.js (HTML), Beamer (latex)
  - keynote: it can copy/paste from pdfs in preview equations, figures etc
  - Beamer is nice except embedding videos requires the use of Flash player inside Adobe Acrobat Reader, so may not be as portable as it seems.
